    "VADER helps us to handle negation, emoticons, slang, abbreviations, and punctuation (like exclamation marks) that enhance sentiment. It also accounts for intensity modifiers (like \"very\" or \"extremely\") that amplify the sentiment of a word and can handle both positive and negative sentiments in a text, allowing for more accurate sentiment analysis. Additionally, VADER is optimized for analyzing informal text, making it particularly effective for use on social media platforms and other user-generated content."

    "Review 3: You open the game and finish your 3000 word essay that's due tomorrow while it loads you into the main menu. You pray they fed the server hamsters today as you queue for a game. You pick Octane cause you like running around fast, not cause he's on drugs. Your teammates pick Caustic and Wraith. It's another TTV Wraith. The champion squad is a pred and 2 master players. The game begins and your caustic spends all game on his own trapping buildings, while you run around juiced up looking for loot and killing anyone in your way. You get jumped by a squad because footstep audio doesn't exist and you couldn't hear them coming. TTV Wraith goes down. You clutch a 1v3 because mastiff is balanced. Meanwhile, your Caustic is setting up traps outside the zone. You collect your Wraith's banner and try to respawn them but they leave with 0.2s left on the timer. You're in awe that this one stayed that long. Someone sees you next to the respawn beacon and kills you. They then immediately get 3rd partied while a far off 4th squad member misses all his kraber shots on them. The predator player shows up out of nowhere and wipes everyone in one sweep, dropping another 4k 20 bomb in the process. Your caustic dies to zone. You're back in the main menu and a random level 500 is waiting there for you in your party. They complain about not having heirlooms despite playing since season 1 but the dude that started last week has 2. You queue for another game. You get disconnected because two server hamsters passed out from hunger. Code: leaf. You wait to load back into the main menu and queue once more, cause you know it's worth going through it all again just to take another glance at Loba's thick ass.\\n\\n10/10. Def recommend\"\n",

    "Explanation The review is classified as a negative review when it should be positive. Reasons given:-\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains a mix of both positive and negative sentiments, but VADER might classify it as negative due to the prevalence of certain phrases and context. Words and phrases like \"you couldn't hear them coming,\" \"your Caustic is setting up traps outside the zone,\" \"you get disconnected,\" and \"server hamsters passed out from hunger\" all carry negative connotations and may influence VADER’s sentiment scoring.\n",
    "The overall narrative starts with complaints and frustrations, which may set a negative tone for the analysis, even if the conclusion is positive. Sentiment analysis algorithms often focus on the overall tone and frequency of negative versus positive expressions in the text."
